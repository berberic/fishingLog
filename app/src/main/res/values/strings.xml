        This application is for logging of technical fly-fishing trips with Google mapping support of the
        stream access points and locations on-stream. Users will be able to predict future insect
        hatches and fish behavior year to year by logging their current activities. The purpose is
        to improve fishing success by knowing what to expect during the year and where to fish from
        prior experience. \n\n

    By logging your fishing experience, it should give you the advanced knowledge for future fishing
    trips. Not every hatch occurs on every stream, nor does a hatch on a stream occur everywhere on a
        stream, nor does a hatch occur at exactly the same day each year. But history can repeat
        itself for insect behavior. By logging precise location information for specific hatches it can
        enhance your future fishing success rate. Building an information base is key to improving
        your flyfishing.\n\nObviously this application can be used for far more things than just fly fishing.

        1. WARNING:Keep your data secure and use encryption!  Create an Encryption Key using a word
        or phrase.  The same word/phrase used to Export (creating the file) must be used to Import
            and decrypt the same file into the database. If no Key is used, then the file will not be
        encrypted/decrypted and will be readable text. You do not have enrypt a file to use the
            import/export feature. This application uses 128-bit AES encryption. If you encrypt, be
            sure to record the key!!!\n\n
        2. By clicking the \'EXPORT All &amp; Save/Send Database as CSV file\' button (above),
        the database of logs will dump into a CSV file and can be emailed as an attachment to anyone
        you choose or saved to your My Drive, or sent via other applications. Most Android devices
        will require you to change your permissions to allow this to happen. Most importantly, you can
        use this feature to backup your data to yourself. \n\n
        3. By clicking the \'EXPORT Selection &amp; Save/Send Database as CSV file\' button (above),
        the database of only the Selected logs will dump into a CSV file and can be emailed as an attachment to anyone
        you choose or saved to your My Drive, or sent via other applications. Most Android devices
        will require you to change your permissions to allow this to happen. You can use this feature
        to send selected logs to another. \n\n

        4. IMPORT CSV button.\nWARNING:This feature is for advanced users. You could delete all your Log data.\n
        By clicking on the \'IMPORT CSV\' button (above), you will be directly uploading a file of
        Log data into the database from the Downloads directory.  Prior to IMPORT, you  must first download
            the file to your device.  Email appended files will download to the Download folder.
        To IMPORT, you must first select a RadioButton to Overwrite or to Append this data. Overwriting will drop
        (delete) all your current data from the database and then insert new data from this file.
        Appending will add this data to your existing database.\n\n
        To choose a file to import, click on the IMPORT Button, then select a CSV file from the Dialog
        screen and click Ok. This reads files that are currently in the Download folder. This import
            file must be a CSV file with the same type of data as in the
        EXPORT file. One way to generate an import CSV file that you can use, is by first using the
        EXPORT Button function to generate this file, and then emailing yourself the file. By
        opening this email on your device and saving the CSV attachment to the Downloads Directory,
        that file is now accessible (selectable) for importing.\n\n
        For Overwriting, it is extremely recommended to test the CSV data first by appending a sample
        of data prior to overwriting. Once data is deleted from the database, there is no recovery.
        If there is an error in the CSV data, this will cause major issues with your Database. Photos
        are not uploadable.\n\n

        5. If the download of the files is not working.  If you are unable to download the CSV file,
            it could be due to your email app has used up all available memory.  Sometimes, it will look
            like your file is stuck in the email app\'s Outbox.  To fix, you will need to clear out the
            memory for your email app on your device. For example, with GMail, you need to go to
            Settings -> Apps -> GMail -> Storage and click on CLEAR DATA.  Alternately, you can reboot
            your device.\n\n

        6. VIEW and DELETE Files (from menu).  This menu button will show all CSV files saved in the
        Download Storage folder. Selecting a file and choosing OK, will delete the file from Storage.

        under Pictures\' folder.\n\n

        8. Details Page:The text field \'Location Description\' should be a written description about the
        access location. Typically this is where you accessed the stream and the direction of travel
        (upstream/downstream). LAT/LNG can be added. The Google Map marker name will be the text in
        the \'Location Description\' field. Use \'Create new Location Desc using Map\' from page menu
        to create this, or use \'Search for existing Location Descriptions\' to add exisiting loaction
        data.\n\n

        9. Details Page:\'LOC LAT/LNG\' button opens a Map to select a GPS Access Location. This is
        a Google MAP with crosshairs in the center of the screen.  This is the selected Lat/Lng. By
        moving the map (or using this current position) and selecting
        \'Add New Mark\' from this page\'s menu, you are selecting this Lat/Lng location to define your
        Access Location. The app will ask for a name for this access location. You can also select
        NORMAL, HYBRID, SATELLITE or TERRAIN menu items for viewing of the map prior to selecting \'Add New Mark\'.
        If wifi is not available Satellite and HYBRID Mapping displays is discouraged. Normal Mapping has the
        least data requirements, and quickest display to view.  If there is no WIFI or Cell Data connection,
        the current location GPS (LAT/LNG) can be saved, without showing a map.  If you have offline mapping,
        sometimes a map can be used.\n

        10. Details Page: Water Temp should be the current temperature where you are fishing. You could also add
        weather information.\n\n
        11. Details Page: Notes field should be a description of special things that you saw during your fishing.
        Including who you went fishing with, names of landowners, and telephone numbers.  All text
        written before a GPS LAT\LNG location will be used as that Marker name on Google Maps. Except,
        any text enclosed within parentheses will not be included in location Marker names. \n\n

        12. Details Page: The \'NOTES LAT/LNG\' button to the right of the \'Notes\' field, will add latitude
        and longitude info into the \'Notes\' field. This could require you to change your permissions
        to allow use your GPS on your phone. The app will ask for a name for this location. This will
        be the marker name for the latitude and longitude for your on-site location. Sometimes buildings or valley
        bottoms have blocked GPS satellite signals.
        This uses the same process as the \'LOC LAT/LNG\' from the Location Field. If there is no WIFI or Cell Data connection,
        the current GPS location (LAT/LNG) can be saved, without showing a map. If you have offline mapping,
        sometimes a map can be used.\n\n

        13. Details Page: If you select the \'Send Location Description and Notes in Report\' checkbox on the
        Details page, the \'Location Description\' field and \'Notes\' data will be in a
        Log Report, otherwise it is not included.\n\n

        14. Details Page: If you select the \'Send Photo in Report\' checkbox on the Details page, the photo will be in a
        Log Report, otherwise it is not included. On some devices, there is a limited amount of email
        storage cache.  If this is exceeded the device will not email until this the device is rebooted,
        or storage cache is cleared.\n\n

        15. Details Page: The \'Send FishLog Report\' Button on the Details Page will create and send an editable Log
        Report to any of your contacts that you choose via email or other applications (Google Keep,
        Google Drive, Message, etc). \n\n

        16. Details Page: The Checkbox for \'Select for limited Exporting to file\' is used by the IMPORT/EXPORT page.
        The Selected log entries will be the only items downloaded for the \'EXPORT limited Selection
        &amp; Save/Send Database as CSV file\'. This setting is also shown on the List Page, but is
        controlled on this page\n\n

        17. Details Page: You can directly view additional Details Pages by swiping on the page left or
        right (chronologically up or down in the default list).\n\n

        18. WARNING:To display maps, either a WIFI connection or Cell connection is required.
        Without cell data connection or a wifi connection maps could appear blank, only showing marks.

        The #3\'View MAP\' from the Detail\'s menu button (top of Details Page screen)
        opens a Google Map view centering on
        the LAT/LNG data found in \'Location Description\' Field. This centering point is displayed
        with a red marker. \nLAT/LNG data must be present or map will not be created and viewed. This
        GPS data can be gotten using the ADD LAT/LNG button or typed in with correct format as the
        GPS button provides. \nThe Map view can be zoomed into or out using the map +- buttons or your fingers.
        \nThe Map also shows your current position with a blue circle or gotten by using the My Location
        Button(right corner).  You can also move (scroll) the viewpoint of the map.  The compass feature
        is also enabled, allowing rotation of the map view.  \nAdditional Google Map Marks are added
        in the map for all Lat/Lng data found in \'Notes\'(also gotten using the GPS button
        for that field), signified by a blue marker. \nAll marker names are the text directly before their
        LAT/LNG data from the Notes Field. Touching a marker on the map displays their marker name.  Touching a marker
        also opens the Google Maps mobile app controls in the lower right of the screen. This enables
        standard routing navigation to this marker from your current location. \nHaving a data connection,
        or wireless is necessary to view map information. This data is not available offline.\n There is a
        menu at the top of the page allowing alternate views of the map page including a Satellite view.\n\n</string>

          This app uses cellphone and wireless connectivity with it mapping abilities.  But it is not required
    to have cell tower connectivity.  It is required to have GPS reception. Which is found mostly universal outside.
        Having wireless connectivity allows the cellphone to have the fast data transfers.  High speed data transfers allows high
    resolution for satellite mapping.  Cell tower connectivity allows the next highest form of data transfer.
    This is not 100% required.  Google Maps provides offline mapping.  This is available directly from the Google Map
    app\'s menu.  You pre-download your map area prior to using it.  This works well for navigation, but
    not as well for Fly-Fish Log map viewing.  However, With no cell tower connectivity, if you have previewed
        the map, the data is now stored in current memory and is still available.\n\n
    This app being on an android phone can also work without a cell phone connection contract, by using a wireless
    connection.  This can be by connecting to a home wireless network, a commercial wireless network or another cellphone\'s
    wireless hotspot.\n\n
